# CitroHacks2023

## Inspiration
Many people spend lots of water without thinking about it, and a lot goes to waste. We wanted to show how much effect we have on the environment and how we can change our habits.
## What it does
Our app allows you to calculate your impact on the environment. Just by answering some questions you can see how much effect you have on the environment, and how you can take action.
## How we built it
We built it using Angular, TypeScript, Html and Css.
## Challenges we ran into
At first we didn't have any idea how we would implement our app, but with brainstorming we figured it out. It was also a challenge to integrate all parts of the website together.
## Accomplishments that we are proud of
We are happy that the project turned out the way it did, we all learned a lot and it was lots of fun.
